At this stage, it is unclear if the application will be able to make the sophisticated logic trees in order
to make specific malnutrition diagnoses. Need to consult Dr. Silver and the medical team to assess
the complexity of diagnosis differentiation.

Assuming that we cannot do so, the note-taking feature of the application will be expanded:
-The final produced note screen will list all symptoms and characteristics discovered for the patient
-Underneath this note will be a list of clinical ICD-10 codes and descriptions of clinical characteristics
-Essentially serving as a quick reference for providers to assess in order to guide their diagnosis
